            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a versatile professional with an academic background encompassing a Master's degree in Nanoscience and a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. It was during my journey of exploration that I sought career paths that bridged technology and biology. The analytical mindset and problem-solving skills I acquired from my scientific background enabled me to quickly adapt to my new role as a software developer trainee by learning a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and data analysis tools. Throughout my career transition, I have demonstrated adaptability, intellectual curiosity, and a passion for continuous learning. My interdisciplinary background allows me to bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and drives my commitment to innovation.</p>
